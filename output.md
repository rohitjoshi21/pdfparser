**1. Bone marrow density 2 SD below the reference level is labeled as:**
a. Normal level
b. Low bone mass
c. Osteoporosis
d. Severe osteoporosis

Ans: b
Ref: Authors: Joel S Finkelstein et al., Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and evaluation of osteoporosis in men

  - Normal: A value for BMD within 1.0 SD of the young adult female reference mean (T-score greater than or equal
to -1.0 SD).

  - Low bone mass (osteopenia): A value for BMD more than 1.0 but less than 2.5 SD below the young adult female
reference mean (T-score less than -1 and greater than -2.5 SD).

  - Osteoporosis: A value for BMD 2.5 or more SD below the young adult female reference mean (T-score less than or
equal to -2.5 SD).

  - Severe (established) osteoporosis: A value for BMD more than 2.5 SD below the young adult female reference
mean in the presence of one or more fragility fractures

**2. Which of the following joint is rarely involved in SLE?**
a. PIP joints
b. Carpal joints
c. Knee joints
d. Sacroiliac joints


-----

##### ONLINE PG NEPAL QAE FALGUN 8

Ans: d
Ref: Authors: Peter H Schur et al., Musculoskeletal manifestations of SLE

  - The arthritis and arthralgias of SLE tend to be migratory; symptoms in a particular joint may be gone within 24
hours.

  - Involvement is usually symmetrical and polyarticular with a predilection for the knees, carpal joints, and joints of
the fingers, especially the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. The ankles, elbows, shoulders, and hips are less
frequently involved. Involvement of the sacroiliac joints and cervical spine may occur but is rare. Monoarticular
arthritis is unusual and suggests an alternative cause such as infection.

  - Morning stiffness is usually measured in minutes and is not prolonged as in RA.

  - The degree of pain often exceeds objective physical findings, and tenderness may be difficult to assess because of
increased pain sensitivity in some patients, either of which can be associated with coexisting fibromyalgia.

**3. The term "Large vessels" in large vessel vasculitis indicates:**
a. Arteries arising from arch of aorta
b. Arteries directly arising from any part of aorta
c. Arteries of size (diameter) more than 5 cm
d. Arteries supplying the main viscera

Ans: a
Ref: International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference on the Nomenclature of Vasculitides (CHCC2012)
A. Large vessel vasculitis
Vasculitis affecting large arteries more often than other vasculitides. Large arteries are the aorta and its major branches.
Any size artery may be affected.
B. Medium vessel vasculitis
Vasculitis predominantly affecting medium arteries defined as the main visceral arteries and their branches. Any size
artery may be affected. Inflammatory aneurysms and stenoses are common.
C. Small vessel vasculitis
Vasculitis predominantly affecting small vessels, defined as small intraparenchymal arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and
venules. Medium arteries and veins may be affected.

**4. The most commonly used drug in sarcoidosis is:**
a. Methotrexate
b. Azathioprine
c. Steroid
d. NSAIDS

Ans: c
Ref: Author:Talmadge E King et al.,Treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis
Glucocorticoids are the most commonly used medication for the treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis, although no
medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of sarcoidosis.
However, some patients with sarcoidosis cannot tolerate or do not respond to glucocorticoids. Several alternative
approaches have been proposed, such as the use of immunosuppressive, cytotoxic, and antimalarial drugs. In addition,
irradiation has been used for neurosarcoidosis and organ transplantation has been performed successfully for end-stage
hepatic, renal, cardiac, or pulmonary disease complicating sarcoidosis. Unfortunately, limited data exist regarding the
indications and efficacy of these approaches in the management of pulmonary sarcoidosis.

**10. Diastolic murmur heard in apex in a case of aortic regurgitation is due to:**
a. Carey coombs murmur
b. Gallavardin phenomenon
c. Austin flint murmur
d. Dock's murmur

Ans: c
Austin Flint murmur — An apical diastolic rumbling murmur has been described in patients with pure aortic regurgitation.
Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the genesis of this murmur, including fluttering of the mitral valve
from the impingement by the aortic regurgitant jet, relative (functional) mitral stenosis, and regurgitant jets directed
against the left ventricular free wall.
Carey-Coombs murmur — In acute rheumatic fever, a mid-diastolic murmur over the left ventricular impulse, a CareyCoombs murmur, has been attributed to acute mitral valvulitis. However, first-degree atrioventricular block (prolonged PR
interval) is common in rheumatic carditis and an increased flow due to earlier atrial systole coinciding with the rapid filling
phase may contribute to a Carey-Coombs murmur.
In older patients with calcific trileaflet AS, an MSM with a musical quality is frequently heard over the cardiac apex or
along the lower left sternal border, in addition to a harsh murmur over the right second interspace. A musical murmur
appears to originate from the vibration of the valve and subvalvular structures and can be recorded in the left ventricular
(LV) cavity (Gallavardin phenomenon); a harsh murmur originates in the aortic root and is related to the high-velocity
ejection jet.
Dock’s murmur occurs when there is a severe stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The murmur
produced is diastolic since the coronary arteries fill in diastole. It is described as early diastolic and decrescendo sounding
similar to the murmur of aortic regurgitation.

reticuloendothelial system in patients with AT. Thymic hypoplasia with cellular and humoral (IgA and IgG2)
immunodeficiencies, premature aging, and endocrine disorders such as type 1 diabetes mellitus are described.

Laboratory Investigation

  - Age-matched serum IGF-I levels are elevated in acromegaly. Consequently, an IGF-I level provides a useful
laboratory screening measure when clinical features raise the possibility of acromegaly.

  - Owing to the pulsatility of GH secretion, measurement of a single random GH level is not useful for the diagnosis
or exclusion of acromegaly and does not correlate with disease severity.
